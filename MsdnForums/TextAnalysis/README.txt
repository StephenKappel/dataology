In this root directory, you will find:
- "Text Analysis of Technical Support Documents.pdf" - This is my paper. It explains why I chose my topic, describes how I attempted to solve text analysis-related problems, and summarizes my results.
- "Text Analysis of Technical Support Documents.pptx" - This is the PowerPoint version of my paper that I plan to present to the class.

All the code referenced in the paper may be found in the "Code" folder. The file names are prefixed with a number indicating the order in which they were developed. This follows the flow of the paper.

Copies of all the plots generated by running the code in the "Code" folder may be found in the "Plots" folder.

If you wish to execute the Python scripts, you will need to configure the local SQL Server database that the code is configured to pull the data from. The database may be setup by installing SQL Server (tested with SQL Server 2012 Express) and building the database using the SQL script saved to my GitHub repo: https://github.com/StephenKappel/dataology/blob/master/MsdnForums/ForumsDb.zip. Assuming the use of Windows, the database should be configured as a data source with a DSN named "LocalSQL".

Enjoy!
